## Testing Framework

[QA Manifesto PDF](https://www.justinkurdila.com/_files/ugd/8fbca8_1d4d65417eb94e85a41e5016e15eb902.pdf)

- `Jest` - Unit/Component Testing
  - `Time-Of-Day/src/tests/unit tests/`
  - `Time-Of-Day/src/tests/component tests/`
- `Mocha`, `Chai`, and `Supertest` - Integration API Testing
  - `Time-Of-Day/src/tests/api tests/`
  - `Mocha` serves as the test runner, managing the execution of your test cases and suites.
  - `Chai` provides the assertions to check the correctness of the responses and behavior.
  - `Supertest` handles making the HTTP requests and receiving responses for your API tests.
- `K6` - Performance Testing
  - `Time-Of-Day/src/tests/performance tests/`
- `Cypress` - UI System Testing
  - `Time-Of-Day/cypress/e2e/`

## Cypress Testing Details

- Evaluating app ui and validating all functionality/behavior.
- All Cypress tests run in github actions against the following browsers:
  - Chrome
  - Firefox
  - Edge
  - Electron
  - Safari (Webkit)

## Performance Testing Details

Four main types of performance tests:

1. Backend API Performance (`k6`)
   - Targeting API endpoints and excercising CRUD functionality.
   - Executing thousands of requests, simulating many concurrent virtual users.
   - Validating request duration, requests per second, failed/passing requests, and response data.
   - Thresholds set for each metric.
2. Frontend Browser Performance (`k6`)
   - Evauluating app UI performance.
   - Executing thousands of requests and page loads, simulating many concurrent virtual users.
   - Validating browser request duration, requests per second, failed/passing requests, [browser metrics](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/metrics/reference/#browser) FCP, LCP, FID, CLS, TTFB, and element/component loading.
   - Thresholds set for each metric.
3. Frontend Browser Page loading (`Cypress`)
   - Evauluating app UI performance.
   - Visiting each page, validating page load, and timing length of page load.
   - Thresholds set for acceptable length of time for page load.
4. Google Lighthouse Performance (`Cypress`)
   - Evauluating app UI performance.
   - Visiting each page and running [Google Lighthouse Performance Metrics](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview)
   - Thresholds set for each [metric](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring).
